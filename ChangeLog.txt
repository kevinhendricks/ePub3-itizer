      the new plugin interface in Sigil 1.0 and 
      to work with epubs with non-standard layouts

V033 
  - Alpe has contributed a major new feature - support for SMIL generation via this plugin and one of his own
  - added hidden="" attribute to nav landmark and page-list (thnaks to Doitsu for pointing this out)
