V032 
-  Fixed typo bug in opf_converter that caused problem with spine properties 
   (Thanks DiapDealer for the fix! And thanks Olivier_g for the bug report!)

-  added lang= and xml:lang= to specify language from opf dc:language for nav.xhtml 

V031
- Fixed nasty bug I introduced in v030 that downcased all ncx tags and removed navPoints
  Thanks for Dotisu for catching this error

V030
-  nav changes to add style in head to prevent display of landmarks
   and to use ol list-style-none

- remove "linear = "yes" from nav entry in spine

- remove DOCTYPE from toc.ncx (not sure if this is correct or not)

- remove guide from content.opf since now optional

- should now properly identify and add manifest properties "scripted"
