V033 
  - Alpe has contributed a major new feature - support for SMIL generation via this plugin and one of his own
  - added hidden="" attribute to nav landmark and page-list (thnaks to Doitsu for pointing this out)
  - added proper id attributes to landmark and nav all allow inline nav styles to work (via patch from Doitsu) 
  - added back passing guide through to the new epub3 opf as aid for backwards compatibility
  - remap media types x-font-ttf and x-font-opentype both to vnd.ms-opentype.  This will change to font-sfnt with Epub 3.1
  

V032 
  -  Fixed typo bug in opf_converter that caused problem with spine properties 
       (Thanks DiapDealer for the fix! And thanks Olivier_g for the bug report!)
  -  added lang= and xml:lang= to specify language from opf dc:language for nav.xhtml 

V031
  - Fixed nasty bug I introduced in v030 that downcased all ncx tags and removed navPoints
       (Thanks for Dotisu for catching this error)

V030
  -  nav changes to add style in head to prevent display of landmarks and to use ol list-style-none
  - remove "linear = "yes" from nav entry in spine
  - remove DOCTYPE from toc.ncx (not sure if this is correct or not)
  - remove guide from content.opf since now optional
  - should now properly identify and add manifest properties "scripted"
